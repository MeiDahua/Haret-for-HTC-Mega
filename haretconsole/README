This directory contains scripts useful for running on a host computer
when interacting with HaRET that is running on a pda.

The main script is invoked by running:

console <ip of phone>

This will telnet to the phone's ip on port 9999.  If the console
script is run from a unix machine, readline capabilities will be
provided.  The program will also automatically disassemble the output
from the "wi" command.

In order for dissasembly to work, a working copy of arm-linux-objdump
should be in the path, in the current directory, or in the directory
the console script is located in.


There are three additional helper scripts in the directory.  The
"dis.py" script can be used to disassemble the output from the raw
"haretlog" files that the console program produces.  The
"scanserial.py" script is a simple program that also takes a haretlog
file as input - it can produce strings from a "wi" command trace of a
serial port.  Finally, "transmem.py" can convert the output from "PD"
back into binary format - it is useful for feeding binary output back
into programs like objdump.
