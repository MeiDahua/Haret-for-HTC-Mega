Welcome.

This is HaRET, the Handheld Reverse Engineering Tool.  For a detailed
description see the files in the docs/ directory.  This file documents
how to build and install it.

HaRET is now compiled with the gcc toolset.  Previous versions (see
cvs tag haret-0_3_8 and earlier) made use of the MSVC/ARM toolkit for
compiling.

The gcc toolset in use is from the cegcc project.  See
http://cegcc.sourceforge.net/ for more info.  The cegcc project is in
active development (as of 20070701).  The recommended way to build
haret is with the prebuilt cegcc rpms found at:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=173455

Obtain the cegcc-mingw32ce package (version 0.50 is known to work) and
install it.  After installing cegcc, one should be able to compile
haret (cd /path/to/haret; make).

It is also possible to build the cegcc toolkit from source.  (Building
cegcc takes a long time and a lot of disk space.)  It is recommended
that you read the cegcc documentation if you wish to do this.  The
following steps may also help:

1 - Obtain cegcc source (svn co
    https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cegcc/trunk/cegcc).  Revision
    931 is known to work (svn up -r 931), however later versions
    should also work.

2 - Optionally alter the build destination by modifying
    src/mingw32ce.sh.  If you do this, be sure to modify HaRET's
    makefile so that the BASE setting is the same.

3 - Build the cegcc toolset (cd src; ./build-mingw32ce.sh)

4 - Wait for toolchain to build.  The build may fail when trying to
    build gdb, but this isn't a problem.

5 - Build HaRET (cd /path/to/haret; make)

The HaRET tool should work on WinCE (2.10 or later) based ARM
processors (arm v4 or later).
