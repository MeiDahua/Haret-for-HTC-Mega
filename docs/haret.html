<h1>What it is</h1>

<p>HaRET stands for "Handheld Reverse-Engineering Tool". In other words it is
a tool that may help you better understand the inner construction of your
handheld even without disassembling it and looking under the cover.

<p>Of course, HaRET is software, and has limits imposed by this, but I hope,
due to source code availability, that you can add functions that suit your
needs if there isn't already one that fits your requirements.

<p>HaRET runs under Windows CE (AKA PocketPC aka Windows XP mobile) since many
PDAs sold without Linux preinstalled (alas, there are still several :) have
this Operating (?) System (?) installed instead. Thus you can use HaRET to
find out how to adapt Linux kernel so that it works properly on your PDA.

<p>Last but not least, HaRET is a very dangerous tool. The author doesn't
take any responsability for any damage caused by this program. Basically it
means: <B>BACKUP ALL YOUR DATA</B> which is not a bad idea in any case, though.

<h2>What it is good for</h2>

<p>HaRET is good for anybody who wants to know better the inner workings of his
PDA, but was primarily designed to help people to port Linux to new PDAs.

<p>But this doesn't mean you can't use it for anything else - for example,
for porting Windows XP Server 2003 to WinCE-based PDAs :-) - the
Linux-specific part is quite small and can be ignored.

<p>Before using this tool, though, it is a neat idea to refresh your
ARM architecture knowledge, and some reading of Intel docs (if you're hacking
an Xscale) would help a lot too. Basically the literature you'll need is
(in decreasing importance order):

<ul>
<li>ARM Architecture Reference Manual
<li>Intel PXA Processor Developer's Manual
<li>Intel PXA Processor Design Guide
<li>Intel Xscale Microarchitecture for the PXA Processor
</ul>

<p>All registered trademarks are registered trademarks of their owners,
blah-blah et al, you know.

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>HaRET has a built-in scripting language, and everything else revolves
around this. Upon startup HaRET launches a file called "startup.txt"
(if it exists), located in the same directory where the executable was
copied to. Then it displays a simple dialog box where you command for
further actions.

<p>The dialog contains a script launcher field, a status bar and a log
window. It also has a <code>"Listen for network connection"</code> button.
That's all you see after the launch, but imagine all the power sleeping
behind that! :-)

<p>Currently HaRET supports only TCP/IP connections, but it's relatively easy
to adapt it in order to use any other connection method such as RS-232
or IrDA (either raw or IrCOMM). So when you tap the big
<code>"Listen for network connection"</code> button
(it is big so that you can press it even with a finger :) it opens the
port 9999 on the PDA and listens for incoming connections. To use this you
must have a TCP/IP connection to your PDA. If you don't have one yet,
<a href="http://synce.sourceforge.net">look here</a>.

<p>After you connect (for example, with <code>telnet 192.168.131.201 9999</code>)
you get an, um, let's call it a command line :) Now you can type 'help' to get
a list of all available commands (with a short descriprion) and read them all,
but I'd say better read the docs first and then use the help just for
reference.

<p>Now you better enable logging in your telnet client, so that you'll
get a full log of what you were doing and what you got (in the case your
PDA locks up :) You can use the "haret" script included in the docs/
directory for use with the regular telnet command (for which I haven't
found how to enable logging).

<h2>The Script Language</h2>

<p>The command language of HaRET is simple. It is not a match to Perl or Python
but it does the job, and that's what it was written for. It could have a complex
grammar written in Bison but it doesn't. It could benefit even from a parser
written in Flex but it doesn't either. Take it or leave it, or - better -
rewrite it if you don't like it :)

<p>In the following we'll use some notations, so let's describe them here
first (it's not sophisticated computer theory, but who knows, maybe you want
to know).

<ul>
<li>[A|B] denotes either A or B
<li>&lt;ABC&gt; denotes a mandatory argument
</ul>

<p>So, [P|V]DUMP denotes either PDUMP or VDUMP, [P|V]F[B|H|W] denotes
either of PFB, PFH, PFW, VFB, VFH, VFW. That's all.

<p>Script interpreter reads input line by line (doesn't matter, from a file,
or from network, or - in some future version - from IrDA or from RS-232
interface). Every line is expected to be either a comment, or a empty line
(which are, naturally, ignored) or a command.

<p>The first word in a command line is, naturally again, the command itself.
Any command name can be shortened to minimal unambiguous length,
e.g. you can use 'p' for 'priint' but not 'v' for 'vdump' since it
conflicts with the 'vd' command ('vdu' is fine, though).

<p>After command you put a number of arguments. The arguments can be either
of string or numeric type. It is better to enclose string arguments in quote
-- either single or double -- because otherwise the parser will stop parsing
the string at first non-alphanumeric character.

<p>Numeric arguments can be complex expressions. You can use any of the
following arithmetic operators (in ascending priority order):

<ul>
<li>'(' ')' (parenthesis)
<li>'+' (addition) '-' (subtraction) '|' (bitwise OR) '^' (bitwise XOR)
<li>'*' (multiplication) '/' (division) '%' (remainder) '&' (bitwise AND)
<li>'+' (unary plus) '-' (unary minus) '~' (bitwise NOT)
</ul>

<p>Numbers can be given in standard C notation (e.g. 123 for decimal, 0x12
for hexadecimal, 0777 for octal). Expression evaluator stops as soon at first
character that it doesn't understand, so usually writing garbage at the end
of line is fine :-)

<p>There are also a number of predefined variables and functions that can be
freely used in expressions; you can get a full list of builtin variables by
invoking the <code>HELP VARS</code> command.

<dl>
<dt>MMU<dd>The 1st level descriptor table physical address
(register 2 of coproc. 15).
<dt>PID<dd>Current value of PID register.
<dt>PSR<dd>The Program Status Register (cpsr).
<dt>VRAM<dd>The physical address of video RAM.
<dt>RAMADDR<dd>Physical RAM start address (default = 0xa0000000).
<dt>RAMSIZE<dd>Physical RAM size (default = autodetected).
<dt>V2P(a)<dd>Return physical address for given virtual address
<dt>P2V(a)<dd>Map temporarily a physical address to virtual and return the address
<dt>CP(p,c)<dd>The value of register c of coprocessor p.
<dt>KERNEL<dd>Linux kernel file name.
<dt>INITRD<dd>Initial Ram Disk file name.
<dt>CMDLINE<dd>Kernel command line.
<dt>BOOTSPD<dd>Boot animation speed, milliseconds/scanline (0-no delay).
<dt>MTYPE<dd>ARM machine type (see linux/arch/arm/tools/mach-types).
<dt>BOOTLINUX<dd>Boots the Linux kernel as specified by the
KERNEL, INITRD, CMDLINE, BOOTSPD and MTYPE variables.
<dt>VMB,VMH,VMW(a)<dd>Virtual Memory Byte/Halfword/Word access.
<dt>PMB,PMH,PMW(a)<dd>Physical Memory Byte/Halfword/Word access.
<dt>IGPIO<dd>The list of GPIOs to ignore during WATCHGPIO. For example,
to ignore GPIO31 changes, issue the command "set IGPIO(31) 1".
<dt>GPLR<dd>General Purpose I/O Level Register.
<dt>GPDR<dd>General Purpose I/O Direction Register.
<dt>GAFR<dd>General Purpose I/O Alternate Function Select Register.
</dl>

<p>You also can define your own variables; they are created the first time
you assign something to them (with the <code>SET</code> command). Then you
can use them as normal variables in expressions. Currently only integer
variables are supported.

<p>To use the value of a built-in variables and functions, use them in
expressions like in high-level languages like Pascal:
<code>print "%x" VRAM+0x10</code> or <code>set x cp(15,2)+0xa00</code>.

<p>To set a value of a function that supports it (e.g. is a R/W function),
use the SET command like here: <code>SET CP(15,2) 0xa0010000</code> or
<code>set PMW(0x14042000) 0xffffffff</code>.

<p>And here's a list of all available commands:

<dl>
<dt>QUIT
<dd>The [Q]ueen of all commands. Quit the remote session.

<dt>HELP [VARS]
<dd>Display a description of either commands or variables.

<dt>MESSAGE &lt;strformat&gt; [&lt;numarg1&gt; [&lt;numarg2&gt; ... [&lt;numarg4&gt;]]]
<dd>Display a message (if run from a script, displays a message box).

<dt>PRINT &lt;strformat&gt; [&lt;numarg1&gt; [&lt;numarg2&gt; ... [&lt;numarg4&gt;]]]
<dd>Same as MESSAGE except that it outputs the text without decorations
directly to the log window and to the network pipe, if there's a network connection.

<dt>BWMEM &lt;size&gt; &lt;rd|wr|rdwr|cp|fwr|frd|fcp|bzero|bcopy&gt;
<dd>Measure PDA's memory performance using Larry McVoy's lmbench routines.
However, since the code is modified (although mostly cosmetically) from the
original, the numbers should NOT be published as the results of lmbench,
but rather as results of HaRET. "size" is memory size for the test; second
operand defines which kind of test to perform.

<dt>SLEEP &lt;milliseconds&gt;
<dd>Sleep for given period of time. Could be used in scripts that change
GPIOs etc.

<dt>DUMP &lt;dumper&gt; [&lt;filename&gt;]
<dd>Dump something to screen (if no filename is given) or to given file.
There are a number of built-in dumpers, and it is quite easy to add new
dumpers. To see the list of built-in dumpers, use the <code>HELP DUMP</code>
command, here is the description of currently available dumpers:

<dl>

<dt>DUMP CP(coprocessor number)
<dd>Dump the 16 registers of given coprocessor. Some coprocessor have more
than 16 registers (register bank is denoted by last numeric argument of a
MRC/MCR command) - for now HaRET doesn't support this, If someone figures out
how to use self-modifying code in WindowsCE, this could be implemented.

<dt>DUMP GPIO
<dd>Dump the GPIO machinery state in a human-readable format. For every GPIO
(0-84 on XScale) it displays info in four columns as shown:

<pre>
GPIO# D S A INTER | GPIO# D S A INTER | GPIO# D S A INTER | GPIO# D S A INTER
------------------+-------------------+-------------------+------------------
  0   I 1 0    FE |  21   I 1 0       |  42   I 1 1       |  63   O 0 3
  1   I 1 2       |  22   O 0 0       |  43   O 1 2       |  64   I 1 0
...
</pre>

The meaning of columns:
<dl>
<dt>GPIO#
<dd>GPIO number
<dt>D
<dd>Direction ([I]nput ot [O]utput).
<dt>S
<dd>State (0 - low, 1 - high). For input pins this is the value read from
external device, for output pin this is the value maintained for the external
device.
<dt>A
<dd>GPIO Alternate Function Number (0-3).
<dt>INTER
<dd>Interrupt detection. RE stands for Rising Edge, FE stands for Falling Edge.
</dl>

<dt>DUMP GPIOST
<dd>Dumps current GPIO register state suitable for include/asm/arch/xxx-init.h
files. The format is very specific to current Linux kernel and could be
modified later.

<dt>DUMP MMU
<dd>Dump the memory map (4Gb address space) to given file. The 1st and
2nd level MMU tables are parsed and results are written. Note that for
some reason this commands works unstable, it often locks the PDA or
(in the best case) pops with a exception.

</dl>

<dt>[V|P]DUMP &lt;filename&gt; &lt;addr&gt; &lt;size&gt;
<dd>Dump an area of memory at given [V]irtual or [P]hysical address to file.

<dt>[V|P]D &lt;addr&gt; &lt;size&gt;
<dd>Same as [V|P]DUMP but outputs to connection rather than to file.

<dt>[V|P]F[B|H|W] &lt;addr&gt; &lt;count&gt; &lt;value&gt;
<dd>Fill memory at given [V]irtual or [P]hysical address with a value.
The B(byte)/H(half-word)/W(word) suffixes selects the size of
&lt;value&gt; and in which units the &lt;count&gt; is measured.
Note that the overall size of the filled block will be rounded up to
nearest word (4-byte) edge.<br>
Take easy with this command! You won't trash the flash ROM with this command,
but you can easily have to hard-reset the PDA after inacurately using this
command (losing all your data).<br>
For example, with the following command you can fill your screen with a nice
blue color:
<pre>
pfh vram 240*320 0x0099
</pre>

<dt>[V|P]F[B|H|W] &lt;addr&gt; &lt;count&gt; &lt;value&gt;
<dd>Fill memory at given [V]irtual or [P]hysical address with a value.
The [B]yte/[H]alfword/[W]ord suffixes selects the size of
&lt;value&gt; and in which units the &lt;count&gt; is measured.

<dt>[V|P]WF &lt;filename&gt; &lt;addr&gt; &lt;size&gt;
<dd>Write a portion of [V]irtual or [P]hysical memory to given file. This is
useful, for example, to dump the boot ROM into a file (usually the first 256K
of ROM at physical address 0) and then disassemble it.

<dt>WATCHGPIO &lt;seconds&gt;
<dd>Watch GPIO pins for given period of time and report changes. This is a
very useful command if you wish to know which GPIO pins are connected to
some hardware. To find out this, you must run this command, and then perform
the actions involving the hardware you're looking after (press buttons,
play sound, insert/remove memory cards and so on). You also may find the
IGPIO function a useful addition to WATCHGPIO.

</dl>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Here is a example HaRET script so that you can get a feeling of
what is it and how it works.

<pre>
# Display some greeting message
print "Welcome to Handheld Reverse Engineering Tool!"
print "Some basic info about your PDA:"
print "MMU L1 descriptor table address is %08x" MMU
print "Video RAM address is %08x" VRAM
print "Current Process ID is %d" PID
print "CPU identification register (p15 r0) is %08x" CP (15, 0)
# Fill top ten scan lines (the run bar) with some color
vfh VRAM 240*10 0x0099</pre>

<h2>The terminal mode</h2>

<p>When connected to HaRET through network it expects to find on the other end
a standard TELNET client, such that it understand a couple of basic commands
from TELNET protocol: disable local echo and disable line-at-once mode.
Thus you can't effectively use programs such as <code>nc</code> to connect
to HaRET since it doesn't support these commands.

<p>In exchange, HaRET allows to nicely interactively edit entered lines. The
following keys are defined and work for now:

<dl>
<dt>ENTER
<dd>Naturally, starts processing the command you just entered :)
<dt>BACKSPACE
<dd>Delete the previously entered character.
<dt>LEFT
<dd>Hide the previous character. This differs from BACKSPACE since the
contents of the line are actually preserved after the cursor and you can
get it back by pressing the RIGHT key.
<dt>UP
<dd>Clear the input line (like pressing LEFT many times)
<dt>RIGHT
<dd>Unhide just one character next to cursor.
<dt>DOWN
<dd>Unhide the rest of line. Initially all the characters from previously
entered line are marked as hidden, thus if you enter a command and press DOWN
you'll get the same command again.
</dl>

<p>Unfortunately, the TELNET daemon emulator on PDA side doesn't support yet
XON/XOFF characters (for this it would be required the input to be handled
by a separate thread), thus you can't press <code>C+S</code>/<code>C+Q</code>
while, say, doing a large memory dump. However, you can enable telnet logging
and then look in the log file if you think you missed something (without even
interrupting the sessin - in a different terminal).

<h2>About HaRET authors</h2>

<p>For now there is just one author, but I would be glad to get code
contributions to the project.

<dl>
  <dt>Andrew Zabolotny &lt;anpaza@mail.ru&gt;
  <dd>The initial developer.
